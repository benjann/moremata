{title:Description}

{pstd}
    {cmd:mm_linbin2()} aggregates data using linear binning by a regular
    grid. Let {it:d} be the step size between grid points and let {it:a} and {it:b} be the
    two nearest grid points below and above an observation {it:x}. Then
    {it:h_a} = {it:w} * ({it:b}-{it:x})/{it:d} is added to the count of point {it:a}
    and {it:h_b} = {it:w} * ({it:x}-{it:a})/{it:d} is added to the count of point
    {it:b}, where {it:w} is the weight associated with {it:x}. Likewise, {it:h_a}/{it:H_a} * {it:y}
    is added to the aggregated data at point {it:a} and {it:h_b}/{it:H_b} * {it:y}
    is added to the aggregated data at point {it:b}, where {it:H_a} ({it:H_b})
    is the total count of point {it:a} ({it:b}). Note that the aggregated data
    will be set to zero (rather than missing) if the total count of a point is
    zero.
