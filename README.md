Main changes:

    03mar2021
    - mm_mloc():
      o function mm_huber_rho() added
      o small change to mm_huber_w() to make it a bit faster

    01dec2020
    - mm_quantile():
      o definitions 6-9 with weighted data and fw=0: the adjustments in the 
        denominator are now in terms of the sample size, not the sum of weights;
        the adjustments in the numerator are now relative to the weights, not
        absolute; the changes imply that results no longer depend on
        the scaling of the weights
      o definitions 3 with weighted data and fw=0: the rule for picking the lower
        or upper value in case of equal distance is now defined in terms of the
        indices of the observations, not the running sum of weights

    23oct2020
    - mm_mloc() and mm_mscale() added (robust M estimation of location and scale)
    - mm_quantile() now also supports the computation of "high" quantile (def=0)
    - mm_srswor() now has argument -alt- to select an alternative algorithm that
      is typically much faster than the default algorithm.
    - mm_sample() now has an additional -alt- argument that is passed through to 
      mm_srswor()
    - mm_sample() now has an additional -nowarn- argument that is passed through to 
      mm_upswor()

    21oct2020
    - mm_hl(), mm_qn(), and mm_mc() added (robust pairwise-based measures of
      location, scale, and skewness)

    19oct2020
    - mm_ranks() implicilty assumed weights to be nonnegative and produced meaningless
      results if mid!=0 was specified in presence of negative weights; this is fixed

    03sep2020
    - mm_median() had argument fw that did not do anything; the argument has now been
      removed

    24aug2020
    - mm_density() now returns error if bandwith cannot be determined 
      (e.g. if data is constant); function D.h() returns missing in this case

    18aug2020
    - function mm_kderiv_triweight() returned incorrect results; this is fixed

    17aug2020
    - mm_density():
      o new public functions D.K() and D.Kd() for observation-level evaluation of
        kernel function or derivative of kernel function using current settings 
        (including boundary correction)
      o some internal changes in organization of approximation estimator to avoid
        redundant computations in some situations

    12aug2020
    - mm_linbin() and mm_exactbin() are now implemented in terms of loops over
      grid points (instead of loops over observations) and are faster (and more 
      accurate) in large datasets
    - new _mm_linbin() and _mm_exactbin() functions for use with sorted data
    - new _mm_fastexactbin() for use with regular grid
    - _mm_fastlinbin() is now slightly faster
    - mm_ddens() and ISJ bandwidth selector in mm_density() now make use of 
      _mm_exactbin() and mm_fastexactbin()
    - mm_density() now makes use _mm_linbin()
    - D.bw() in mm_density() now allows argument adjust also in case of 
      user-provided bandwidth

    11aug2020
    - mm_density()
      o applied some renaming: D.bwmethod() is now D.bw() (furthermore, D.bw()
        now returns the user bandwith, if set, instead of the bandwidth method)
        D.bcmethod() is now D.bc(); D.bwadjust() is now D.adjust()
      o D.support() without argument now returns (lb(), ub())
    - mm_ddens() as well as ISJ bandwidth selector in mm_density(): now using exact
      binning as in code by Botev; exact binning leads to inaccurate results if the
      grid size is small, but the error vanishes with increasing grid size; linear
      binning is more precise for small grid sizes, but it leads to non-vanishing
      error at the boundaries (doubling the first and last grid count does not
      seem to help); mm_ddens() now uses default grid size of 2^14 (as in code by
      Botev); ISJ in mm_density() enforces a grid of at least 2^10

    10aug2020
    - new mm_ddens() function for diffusion density estimation
    - mm_density():
      o ISJ bandwidth selector wrongly used grid size instead of number of obs when
        rescaling the bandwidth; this is fixed
      o increased padding of approximation grid to +/- 10% of data range (instead of
        +/- 5% percent)
      o D.n() now has an additional argument to set the padding proportion

    07aug2020
    - mm_density():
      o now using DPI if SJPI/ISJ fails
      o ISJ now uses same root-finding algorithm as SJPI
      o SJPI and DPI now compute the scale from the binned data
      o SJPI now uses min of sd and iqr as scale measure when computing the
        oversmoothed bandwidth; this is at odds with h_os(), but may add some
        robustness; furthermore, root finder now uses full precision
      o extension of automatic grid is now limited to 5% of range on either side
      o D.kernel() always selected gaussian; this is fixed
      o D.support(.,"",1) returned error; this is fixed

    06aug2020
    - new mm_density() funtion for (univariate) kernel density estimation
    - new mm_minim() funtion for univariate minimization without derivatives

    04aug2020

      elements in a matrix
    - new mm_seq() function to generate regular sequences

    17jul2020

      to be nonzero and now allow multiple columns in P
    - new mm_issorted() function
    
    14jul2020
    - mm_quantile() has been rewritten; it now supports all 9 quantile definitions
      from from Hyndman and Fan (1996); weights are supported for all 
      definitions; new argument -fw- requests treating the weights as frequency
      weights
      ***
      IMPORTANT CHANGE:
          argument -altdef- in mm_quantile() and mm_iqrange() has been replaced
          by argument -def- that can take on values 1 to 9; altdef!=0 in the 
          previous version is equivalent to def=6 in the new version
      ***
    - new functions _mm_quantile(), _mm_median(), and _mm_iqrange() that assume
      sorted data
    - new functions mm_unique(), mm_unique_tag(), mm_uniqrows(), 
      mm_uniqrows_tag() to obtain or tag unique values in a vector or unique
      rows in a matrix; mm_uniqrows() differs from official uniqrows() in that
      it has an option to determin the order in which the result is returned
    - new functions _mm_nunique(), _mm_unique(), _mm_unique_tag(), 
      _mm_nuniqrows(), _mm_uniqrows(), and _mm_uniqrows_tag() to count, obtain,
      or tag unique values/rows without sorting the data
    - function mm_ipolate() is now faster, especially if there are ties
    - new _mm_ipolate() function that assumes sorted data
    - new mm_fastipolate() function that assumes sorted and unique data 
    - new mm_group() function for creating a group index
    - new mm_sort()/mm_order() functions for stable sorting

    - new mm_kderiv() function for kernel derivatives
    - new mm_ecdf2()/_mm_ecdf2() functions that return the CDF at unique values
      of X
    - argument -mid- in mm_ranks() did not make sense with ties=0 or ties=4; 
      this is fixed
    - function mm_relrank() has been reqritten; it now has additional 
      arguments support breaking ties and to compute nonnormalized ranks
    - new _mm_ecdf() function that assumes sorted data
    - new _mm_ranks() function that assumes sorted data
    - new _mm_relrank() function that assumes sorted data
    - mm_ranks() now uses quad precision in Stata 10 or newer
    - mm_ecdf(), mm_ranks(), and mm_relrank() now have separate help files
    - mm_colrunsum() now has argument -missing- to treat missing values as missing
      (instead of zero) and argument -quad- to request quad precision in Sata 10 
      or newer
    - mm_isconstant() now uses allof() instead of all() and is thus faster

    - mm_ebal(): handling of collinearity/redundant constraints improved

    04may2019

      fixed
